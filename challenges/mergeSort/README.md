# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement merge sort

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement merge sort

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time: O(n logn)
Space: O(n): because the function depends on the number of inputs so the space chages linearly with inputs number
