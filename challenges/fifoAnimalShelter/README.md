## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
add and remove dogs to and from the animal shlter using first-in first-out approach

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
    BigO: 
        Time: O(1): the input is the same and we don't have any for loos or recursive operation
        Space: O(n) the size of the array increase if we kept adding new animals

## Solution
