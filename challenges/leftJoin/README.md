# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
BigO:
    time: O(n): the execution time changes linarly with the inputs number
    space: O(n): the space is increase linearly with the number of inputs through the whole operation
