# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create Hashtable class which has four methods hash, add, get, contains

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create Hashtable class which has four methods hash to hash the key, add which add the key and its value in the corresponding index, get print the value of the selected key, contains check if the key if it contain any values

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

add() ==> BigO time: O(1) the run time is constant because we are adding to specific index without any loop
               space: O(n) the space increses every time we add new value

get() ==> BigO time: O(1) the run time is constant because we are adding to specific index without any loop
               space: O(1) the space doesn't increase and is constant throght the whole operation

contain() ==> BigO time: O(1) the run time is constant because we are adding to specific index without any loop
                   space: O(1) the space doesn't increase and is constant throght the whole operation
