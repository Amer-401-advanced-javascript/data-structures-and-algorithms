## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
BigO: 
    Time: O(log n): the execution time change logarithmically depending on the size of the given string
    Space: O (n): the space depend on the size of the string
