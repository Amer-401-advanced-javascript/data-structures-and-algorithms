# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Sort the array using quick sort algorithm
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Sort the array using quick sort algorithm
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(log n):  because the function depends on the number of inputs so the space changes logarithmically with inputs number
