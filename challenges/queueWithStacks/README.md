# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
enqueue and dequeue using the stack methods only

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create new Queue class. without using existing Queue. Instead, this Queue class will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 
 enqueue(): time O(1) the execution time doesn't change with the input becuase we are always removing from the front of the queue

            space O(1) the number of input is constant

dequeue(): time O(n) the execution time change with the input becuase we are are looping in the secondStack

            space O(1) the number of input is constant
