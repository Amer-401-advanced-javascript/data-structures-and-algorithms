# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
return duplicate values found in two given trees.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
return duplicate values found in two given trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
BigO:
    time: O(n): the exrcution time changes linarly with the inputs number
    space: O(n): the space is increase linearly with the number of inputs through the whole operation
