# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
linked list is a type of linear data structure used to organize data where each element is a seperate object(node)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Here we are trying to sort the data in linked list, check if a specific item does exist in the linked list and to print out the linked list and apply various methods on the linked_list (the methods are explained below)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
insert() ====> time O(n), space O(1)

includes() ===> time O(n), space O(1)

toString() ===> time O(n), space O(n)

append() ====> time O(n), space O(1)

insertBeforeValue() ====> time O(n), space O(1)

insertAfter() ====> time O(n), space O(1)

readFromTheEnd() ====> time O(n), space O(1)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
* insert method used to enter new node  into the linked list 
* includes method used to search for a certain element in the linked list
* toString method used to print out the exsiting linked list
* append method used to add a value at the end of the linked list 
* insertBeforeValue method used to add a value before an exisiting value in the linked_list
* insertAfter method used to add a value after an already exisiting value in the linked_list
* readFromTheEnd() method use to return the value of the node by counting from the end of the linked_list
