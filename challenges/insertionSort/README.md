<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Insertion Sort

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time: O(n^2)
The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.
Space: O(1)
No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).
